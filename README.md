TriSakay is a ride-booking service aimed at providing a convenient and accessible transportation solution. The project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities, contributing to the development of sustainable urban areas. It incorporates key object-oriented programming principles to enhance both its structure and functionality.

## TriSakay and SDG 11

Sustainable Development Goal 11 focuses on making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. TriSakay plays a crucial role in achieving this goal by:

- **Reducing Carbon Footprint:** Tricycles are eco-friendly modes of transportation, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment.

- **Enhancing Accessibility:** TriSakay ensures that transportation is readily accessible to all members of the community, promoting inclusivity in urban areas.

- **Efficient Urban Mobility:** By streamlining tricycle rides, TriSakay contributes to efficient urban mobility, reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable transportation alternatives.


## Technology Stack

TriSakay leverages the following technologies for its development:

- ![SQLite Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sqlite-003B57?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)
  **as the Local Database:** For local data storage needs, TriSakay relies on SQLite, a lightweight, embedded database system. SQLite is ideal for quick data access, crucial for the responsiveness of a ride-booking service.

- ![Flutter Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white)
  **for Cross-Platform Compatibility:** TriSakay is built using Flutter, a framework known for its cross-platform compatibility. With a single codebase, the app is designed to run on ![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-3DDC84?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&logoColor=white) platforms.

- ![Dart Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-0175C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white)
  **for Modern Syntax and AOT Compilation Support:** The project utilizes Dart as its programming language, offering a modern syntax and supporting Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for efficient execution and improved performance.


## Development Features
