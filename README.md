# TriSakay: Your Trusted Partner for Smooth Tricycle Journeys

TriSakay is a ride-booking service aimed at providing a convenient and accessible transportation solution. The project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities, contributing to the development of sustainable urban areas.

## Technology Stack

TriSakay leverages the following technologies for its development:

- **Flutter for Cross-Platform Compatibility:** TriSakay is built using Flutter, a framework known for its cross-platform compatibility. With a single codebase, the app is designed to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

- **Dart for Modern Syntax and AOT Compilation Support:** The project utilizes Dart as its programming language, offering a modern syntax and supporting Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for efficient execution and improved performance.

- **SQLite as the Local Database:** For local data storage needs, TriSakay relies on SQLite, a lightweight, embedded database system. SQLite is ideal for quick data access, crucial for the responsiveness of a ride-booking service.

## Development Features
